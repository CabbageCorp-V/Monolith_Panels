## What's this?
Overcomplicated panels.

## Use: 
- The CAD contains everything that's needed for V2/VT 250/300/350mm with BOM thickness panels (3mm) and is also a good assembly guide.
- It's intended to be used with another layer of 3mm foam tape or with 5mm foam tape paired with 4mm panels (Monolith Gantry stepper protrusion is 3.6mm).
- Feel free to remix the parts for different setups!
- Parts will load in the correct orientation when exported.
- The corners can be used without the straights, but your mileage may vary if you don't put VHB on them.
- When used as a panel frame you can get away with putting VHB only in the middle.
- Recommended shrinkage compensation for the parts when printed in ABS is 99.3-99.5%. Make sure to test this before committing to printing huge amounts of plastic, because shrinkage can be 3-4mm in total.
- Clips are fairly sensitive to EM/PA, but can be easily scaled to fit perfectly in the other plastic parts. They're not sensitive to alu extrusion tolerances.

## BOM
### DISCLAIMER: This is a challenging mod and lot of the stuff is still untested. The BOM quantities can greatly vary based on how you build it. Always refer to CAD.
