## What's this?
Overcomplicated panels.

## Use:
- The CAD contains everything that's needed for V2/VT 250/300/350mm with BOM thickness panels (3mm) and is also **a good assembly guide**.

- The vertical printed part length is determined by the theoretical Z travel and NOT the bed size. Pick the vertical part length based on the Z travel of your machine. Tridents usually have a 250mm Z regardless of the bed size, except the cubed kits.

- It's intended to be used with **another layer of 3mm foam tape** or with 5mm foam tape paired with 4mm panels (Monolith Gantry stepper protrusion is 3.6mm).

- Feel free to remix the parts for different setups!

- Parts will load in the correct orientation when exported.

- The corners can be used without the straights, but your mileage may vary if you don't put VHB on them.

- When used as a panel frame you can get away with putting VHB only in the middle.

- Recommended **shrinkage compensation** for the parts when printed in **ABS is 99.3-99.5%**. Make sure to test this before committing to printing huge amounts of plastic, because shrinkage can be 3-4mm in total.

- Clips are fairly sensitive to EM/PA, but can be easily scaled to fit perfectly in the other plastic parts. They're not sensitive to alu extrusion tolerances.

## BOM
### DISCLAIMER: This is a challenging mod and a lot of the stuff is still untested. The BOM quantities can greatly vary based on how you build it. Always refer to CAD.

|No.|Description|Qty|
|---|---|---|
|1.|M3x16 SHCS or BHCS|probably more than 10|
|2.|M3x6 BHCS or M3x8 FHCS (better)|definitely more than 10|
|3.|M3 nuts|probably more than 10|
|4.|M3x5x4mm heatset inserts|definitely more than 10|
|5.|VHB tape|enough|
|6.|Foam tape|enough|
|7.|4mm OD PTFE tube|exactly 96mm|
